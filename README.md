# Chemical-Engineering-Database
I am creating a database for chemical engineers consisting of spectroscopy data to thermodynamic tables so that engineers can do more work in less time

This is version 3.00 for Public Testing.
Infrared Spectroscopy Data is based on the website
https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Ancillary_Materials/Reference/Reference_Tables/Spectroscopic_Parameters/Infrared_Spectroscopy_Absorption_Table 


The steam properties are based on IAPWS 95 and IAPWS 97. IAPWS 95 is based on the NIST DATABASE 
http://www.nist.gov/srd/upload/NISTIR5078.htm

IAPWS 97 is based on the Python implementation of standards from The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam(IAPWS)
https://pypi.org/project/iapws/

Antoine tables and its database is based on the work by
Yaws, C.  L.  and Yang, H.  C. "To estimate vapor pressure easily, antoine coefficients relate vapor pressure to temperature for almost 700 major organic compounds", Hydrocarbon Processing, 68(10), p65-68, 1989'

Critical Properties and Acentric Factors are based on the work by
C. L. Yaws and P. K. Narasimhan, “Critical properties and acentric factor—organic compounds,” in Thermophysical properties of chemicals and hydrocarbons, Elsevier, 2009, pp. 1–95.
and
C. L. Yaws, “Critical Properties and Acentric Factor – Organic Compounds,” in Thermophysical properties of chemicals and hydrocarbons, 2nd ed., William Andrew, 2014

INTRODUCTION:

I am NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER. I have done some courses on Python from Coursera and have started on this journey. I am a Chemical Engineer by profession and will soon start my PhD. Since due to the pandemic, I have a lot of free time so I wanted to utilize it by doing something. Hence I embarked on this journey.

INSTRUCTION FOR DOWNLOADING AND SETUP:

If you have Python installed on your PC, then just copy the "Chemical_engineering_toolkit.py" file and "Master.db" file, copy both files to a folder and run the program by clicking on "Chemical_engineering_toolkit.py" file. Some libraries will need to installed manually like numpy, sci-py, iapws, beautifulSoup and tabulate.For general users, download the files from the link given below and extract them. Now run by clicking on the exe "Chemical_engineering_toolkit.exe". Please make sure that the "Master.db" file is present in the same folder as the exe file.

DOWNLOAD LINKS:

The program contains all libraries and python executables in itself and is huge in file size. Since GitHub Doesnot allow files larger than 25 MB so the binary files were uploaded to Google drive. Please Download from Google Drive Link

GUIDELINES FOR USING:

ANTIVIRUS WARNING:
I personally tested it and can gurantee that my program is free from any malware. But please check the files and always download files from the official source. 

FUTURE UPDATES:
I do not know when!!! But I want to add UV/VIS, NMR, Genomic Data and other thermodynamic data that facilitates the research work of most engineers.

Thank you for your patience.
