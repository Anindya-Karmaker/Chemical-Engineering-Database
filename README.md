# Chemical-Engineering-Database
I am creating a database for chemical engineers consisting of spectroscopy data to thermodynamic tables so that engineers can do more work in less time

This is version 1.00 for Public Testing.
Initially it contains only infrared spectroscopy database collected from 
"https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Ancillary_Materials/Reference/Reference_Tables/Spectroscopic_Parameters/Infrared_Spectroscopy_Absorption_Table"
=========I DO NOT OWN ANY RIGHTS FOR THE DATABASE!==============

INTRODUCTION:
I am NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER. I have done some courses on Python from Coursera and have started on this journey. I am a Chemical Engineer by profession and will soon start my PhD. Since due to the pandemic, I have a lot of free time so I wanted to utilize it by doing something. Hence I embarked on this journey.

INSTRUCTION FOR DOWNLOADING AND SETUP:
If you have Python installed on your PC, then just copy the "IR_DATABASE_DOWNLOADER.py" file and "IR_DATA.sqlite" file, copy both files to a folder and run the program by clicking on "IR_DATABASE_DOWNLOADER.py" file. For general users, just copy the "IR_DATABASE_DOWNLOADER.exe" and "IR_DATA.sqlite" file and run the program just like any EXE.
I REPEAT THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE "IR_DATA.sqlite" FILE IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE PYTHON FILE OR EXE FILE.

GUIDELINES FOR USING:
Enter the IR wavenumber(per cm) as obtained from IR Spectroscopy data. Then select "Estimate Functional Group" button to show the corresponding matching functional groups. You can also limit the chemical group and type of vibration by choosing the options from the listbox or searching it via "Search" button. Once in a year or two, you can update the database for any new compounds. PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE THE DATABASE ALWAYS SINCE I DO NOT OWN ANY RIGHTS ON THE WEBSITE OR DATABASE.

ANTIVIRUS WARNING:
I personally tested it and can gurantee that my program is free from any malware. But please check the files and always download files from the official source. 

FUTURE UPDATES:
I do not know when!!! But I want to add UV/VIS, NMR, Genomic Data and thermodynamic data that facilitates the research work of most engineers.

Thank you for your patience.
